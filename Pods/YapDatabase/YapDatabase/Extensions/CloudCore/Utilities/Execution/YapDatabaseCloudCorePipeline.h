 * A "pipeline" represents a queue of operations for syncing with a cloud server.

 * Generally speaking, a graph is all the cloud operations that were generated in a single commit (for a
 * specific pipeline). Within the graph are the various operations with their different dependencies & priorities.
 * The operations within a graph will be executed in accordance with the set dependencies & priorities.
 * 
 * The pipeline manages executing the operations within a graph.
 * It also ensures that graphs are completed in commit order.
 * 
 * That is, if a pipeline contains 2 graphs:
 * - graph "A" - representing operations from commit #32
 * - graph "B" - represending operations from commit #33
 * 
 * Then the pipeline will ensure that all operations from graphA complete before any operations from graphB start.
